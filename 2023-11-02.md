## Freeing memory tricks 

In your `ft_gen_words` function, you originally had the following code:

```c 
char *ft_gen_words(char *split, int len)
{
    int i;
    char *word;

    word = (char *)malloc(len + 1);
    if (!word)
    {
        free(word);  // This line is problematic
        return (0);
    }

    i = 0;
    while (i < len)
    {
        word[i] = split[i];
        i++;
    }
    word[i] = '\0';
    return (word);
}
```

The issue here is that you're attempting to free the `word` immediately after allocating it. However, if the allocation fails (`malloc` returns NULL), there is no memory to free, and attempting to free it will lead to undefined behavior.

Here's the corrected `ft_gen_words` function:

```c 
char *ft_gen_words(char *split, int len)
{
    int i;
    char *word;

    word = (char *)malloc(len + 1);
    if (!word)
        return (0);

    i = 0;
    while (i < len)
    {
        word[i] = split[i];
        i++;
    }
    word[i] = '\0';
    return (word);
}

```

In this corrected code, if `malloc` fails to allocate memory for `word`, it simply returns NULL without trying to free the memory, which is the correct behavior. The memory allocated by `malloc` will be properly freed in your `ft_split` function if an allocation failure occurs during the word generation loop.
