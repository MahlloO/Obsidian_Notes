- ## Assignment tricks 

The expression `*d++ = *s++;` involves pointer arithmetic and post-increment operators. Let's break down what happens step by step:

1. `*d` and `*s` are pointers, and they point to the values you want to copy from source (`s`) to destination (`d`).
    
2. `*d++` and `*s++` use the post-increment operator (`++`) which means the current values of `d` and `s` are used, and then, after that usage, their values are incremented by 1. In other words, they are used first, and then the pointers are incremented.
    
3. `*d++ = *s++;` copies the value pointed to by `s` to the location pointed to by `d`, and then both `d` and `s` are incremented.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of what happens:
- The value pointed to by `*s` is copied to the memory location pointed to by `*d`. This is equivalent to `*d = *s`.
- Both `d` and `s` are incremented by 1.  after this operation, `d` and `s` now point to the next locations in memory.

```This is a common idiom in C and C++ for copying values from one memory location to another, especially when working with arrays or sequences. It's important to understand the order of operations and ensure that both `d` and `s` are valid and point to appropriate memory locations before using this expression to avoid undefined behavior. ```
