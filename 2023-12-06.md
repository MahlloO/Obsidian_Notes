## Memory Tricks
---
The operating system manages the memory space for a running program, and the specific addresses assigned to variables or allocated memory can change for several reasons:

1. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">**Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR):** </mark>Many modern operating systems employ ASLR, a security feature that randomizes the base addresses of executable and dynamic link library (DLL) files, as well as the positions of the stack, heap, and memory-mapped regions. This randomization helps prevent certain types of security exploits, as it makes it harder for an attacker to predict the location of specific code or data in memory.
   
2. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">**Memory Allocation and Deallocation:** </mark>The dynamic allocation of memory (using functions like `malloc`, `calloc`, etc.) can result in different addresses being assigned to variables or data structures in each run. The specific memory locations are influenced by the state of the memory at the time of allocation.

3. <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">**Stack and Heap Dynamics:**</mark> The stack and heap, two important memory regions, are subject to dynamic changes during program execution. Variables with automatic storage duration (local variables) are typically stored on the stack, and their addresses can change as the stack grows and shrinks during function calls. Memory allocated with `malloc` or similar functions is typically on the heap, and the address can vary based on heap management decisions.

In summary, the operating system introduces randomness and variability in memory addresses <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">to enhance security</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">provide flexibility </mark>for memory management. This is why you observe different addresses between different runs or calls of your program.
