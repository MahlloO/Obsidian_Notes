- handling  memory overlap

>In the forward copy loop (`if (d < s)`), where `dest` is before `src`:

1. It starts from the beginning of the memory block (`s`) and moves towards the end.
2. The source data is read from the start and then copied to the destination (`d`).

This ensures that the source data is fully read before it is overwritten. If we were to perform a simple forward copy without checking the relative positions of `dest` and `src`, and if there were an overlap, we might end up overwriting data in the source region before it has been read, leading to incorrect results.

By using the forward copy approach when `dest` is before `src`, the function guarantees that each byte of data is read from the source (`s`) before being written to the destination (`d`).

In the backward copy loop (`else`), where `dest` is after `src`:

1. It starts from the end of the memory block (`s`) and moves towards the beginning.
2. The source data is read from the end and then copied to the destination (`d`).

This ensures that the destination data is fully written before it might be read from the source. It prevents overwriting data in the source region before it has been copied.

The key is to ensure that, during the copy process, you don't overwrite data in the source region that you still need to read. The forward and backward copy loops are designed to handle this correctly, depending on the relative positions of `dest` and `src`.
