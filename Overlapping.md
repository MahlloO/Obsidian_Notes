Overlapping, in the context of memory or data structures, refers to a situation where two or more regions of memory or data occupy the same memory space, or they share a portion of their memory space. In other words, they "overlap" in memory, meaning that some of the data in one region occupies the same memory locations as data in another region.

Here are a few common scenarios where overlapping can occur:

1. **Memory Overlap:** In memory operations, overlapping can occur when two memory regions, such as arrays or buffers, share common memory addresses. This can happen intentionally or accidentally. When you copy or move data between these regions, it's important to handle the overlap correctly to avoid data corruption.
    
2. **Data Structures Overlap:** In data structures like structs or unions, overlapping can occur when multiple fields or members share the same memory space. Unions, in particular, allow different fields to occupy the same memory location, depending on which field is being accessed.
    
3. **Bitfields Overlap:** In some programming languages, you can define bitfields within data structures. These bitfields can overlap, meaning that multiple fields share the same bits within a single storage unit (typically a byte).
    
4. **File Overlap:** In file systems, overlapping can occur when two or more files or file regions share the same storage space on a storage medium. This is often seen in file systems that support hard links or symbolic links.
    

Overlapping can be intentional and used for specific purposes, such as optimizing memory usage or sharing data between different parts of a program. However, it can also lead to unintended consequences if not handled correctly. When dealing with overlapping data, it's important to use appropriate functions and techniques, such as `memmove`, to ensure data integrity and avoid data corruption when copying or moving data between overlapping regions.
