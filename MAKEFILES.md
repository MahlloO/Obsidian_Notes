``` NOTE: 
The goal of Makefiles is to compile whatever files need to be compiled, based on what files have changed
```

## Why Makefile exist?
---

- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Makefiles</mark> are used to help decide which parts of a large program need to be recompiled. In the vast majority of cases, C or C++ files are compiled. Other languages typically have their own tools that serve a similar purpose as Make.
- Popular C/C++ alternative build systems are [SCons](https://scons.org/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Bazel](https://bazel.build/), and [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org/). Some code editors like [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) have their own built in build tools. For Java, there's [Ant](https://ant.apache.org/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html), and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/). Other languages like Go, Rust, and TypeScript have their own build tools.
