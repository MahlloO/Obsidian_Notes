## Character Before Unicode 

Fundamentally, computers just deal with numbers. They store letters and other characters by assigning a number for each one. Before Unicode was invented, there were hundreds of different systems, called<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;"> character encodings,</mark> for assigning these numbers. These early character encodings were limited and could not contain enough characters to cover all the world's languages. Even for a single language like English no single encoding was adequate for all the letters, punctuation, and technical symbols in common use.

Early character encodings also conflicted with one another. That is, two encodings could use the same number for two _different_ characters, or use different numbers for the _same_ character. Any given computer **(especially servers)** would need to support many different encodings. However, when data is passed through different computers or between different encodings, <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">that data runs the risk of corruption.</mark>****

The emergence of the Unicode Standard and the availability of tools supporting it are among the most significant recent global software technology trends.
