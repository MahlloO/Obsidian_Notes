The choice between Debian and Rocky Linux (or any other Linux distribution) depends on your specific needs, preferences, and the context in which you're deploying the operating system. There's no one-size-fits-all answer, and what might be "best" for one use case may not be optimal for another. Here are some factors to consider when making a decision:

2. **<mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Package Management</mark>:**
