## Passing Arguments  as *<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Pointer</mark>* to change the original value (pointer)

When you pass a pointer to a function in C, you are passing a copy of that pointer. Changes made to the copy inside the function do not affect the original pointer in the calling code. This is why, in certain situations, you might need to use a double pointer (pointer to a pointer) to allow the function to modify the original pointer itself.

Let's delve into more detail with your specific example. When you pass `line` to the `edit_line` function without using a double pointer:
Prototype :

```c
char *edit_line(char *str, int len, char *g_line);  
```

Function calls

```c
 str = edit_line(str, e_line, line);
```

And the corresponding definition:

```c
char *edit_line(char *str, int len, char *g_line)
{ 
char *s = str_sub(str, len + 1);     
if (!s)         
	return NULL;      
g_line = str_sub(str + len + 1, ft_strlen(str + len + 1));     
if (!g_line)
{         
	free(s);         
	return NULL;     
}
free(str);     
printf("\n==rst_line:%s\n", g_line);
return s;
}
```

In this case, `g_line` is a local variable inside the `edit_line` function. When you assign a new value to `g_line`, you are modifying the local copy of the pointer, not the original pointer that was passed to the function. Therefore, changes to `g_line` do not persist outside the function.

On the other hand, when you use a double pointer:
```c
char *edit_line(char *str, int len, char **g_line);  
```
Function calls 
```c
str = edit_line(str, e_line, &line);
```
And the corresponding definition:
`
```c
char *edit_line(char *str, int len, char **g_line) 
{     
char *s = str_sub(str, len + 1);
if (!s)         
	return NULL; 
*g_line = str_sub(str + len + 1, ft_strlen(str + len + 1)); 
if (!*g_line) 
{         
	free(s); 
	return NULL; 
}
free(str);     
printf("\n==rst_line:%s\n", *g_line);
return s;
}
```

Here, `g_line` is a pointer to a pointer. When you dereference `g_line` using `*g_line`, you are accessing the original pointer passed to the function. Assigning a new value to `*g_line` modifies the original pointer, and those changes persist outside the function.

```
In summary, if you want to modify the original pointer passed to a function and have those changes persist outside the function, you use a double pointer. If you only want to modify the data pointed to by the pointer, a single pointer is sufficient.
