The expression `((char *)s)[i]` is a type-casting operation followed by array indexing, and it's used to access the `i`-th byte within the memory area pointed to by `s`. Here's a breakdown of the expression `((char *)s)[i] == (char)c`:

1. `s` is a pointer to a memory area, but it is a `void*`, which means it is typeless and can't be directly indexed because the compiler doesn't know the size of the data it points to.
    
2. `((char *)s)` is a type-casting operation that converts the `void*` pointer `s` into a `char*` pointer. This type-casting informs the compiler that we are treating the memory as an array of bytes (characters). It allows us to access individual bytes within the memory area pointed to by `s`.
    
3. `((char *)s)[i]` then accesses the `i`-th byte within the memory area by treating it as an array. The type-casting allows this indexing operation.
    
4. `== (char)c` compares the byte at index `i` (accessed using `((char *)s)[i]`) with the character `c` by casting `c` to a `char`. This comparison checks if the current byte in memory matches the specified character.
    

So, the entire expression `((char *)s)[i] == (char)c` checks if the `i`-th byte in the memory area pointed to by `s` is equal to the character `c` by treating the memory as an array of bytes. If the comparison is true, it means that the byte `c` was found within the memory area, and the function returns a pointer to its location in memory. If the comparison is false, it continues searching through the memory area.
